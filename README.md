An unofficial telegram client for personal use. I tried to edit the code and make changes as much as possible. The fact is that most telegram clients are overloaded with functionality and add up at times (I have no idea, maybe because of the overload of functionality there is a memory leak, idk I am not an android developer).

Client functions:
1) The original package and the name, there is a comit where a hash specific to the original telegram was added, it is not needed if you are not going to change the package.

2) Ads removed

3) It is allowed to take screenshots (in stories too)

4) It is allowed to copy messages and make screenshots in channels with restrictions

5) Local Premium

6) The emulator's detection is disabled

I tried to make it as vanilla as possible.
